I developed my own style of motion art effects utilizing GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform).
Motion Art Effect is a modern and visually appealing web application built with React and GSAP.
It features a dynamic and engaging design with smooth animations and a responsive layout,
aimed at transforming and enhancing the user experience.
